        Division One Volleyball Player<br><br>
My name is Ashley Dittmann and I have minor job experience. I have worked as an indoor volleyball high school coach and a beach volleyball coach. I love teaching kids and young adults skills that I have mastered. I love wathcing them grow into great and amazing players. These things are up my ally because I am a volleyball player. Due to being on the University of California, Riverside Division One Volleyball team, my schedule is packed. However, I do have minor job experience. I am an outside hitter for the women's team and love the sport of volleyball. During season, my schedule is jam packed. My day consists of waking up at seven in the morning to go to practice. Practice lasts three hours then its off to class. On a normal. day, I have two or three classes. These classes are about 50 minutes long and allows me to have time to nap before weights and conditioning. At approximately four in the afternoon, the team has weights and conditioning for about two hours. We usually run and lift during this time. Some may thing my day would be over; however, it is now time for study hall. I am required to do about four hours of study hall each week, so it depends on how much time I go for each day.  Volleyball has always been my passion; however, I do enjoy many other things. First off, I love to dance. I am an avid dance fitness athlete. Dance fitness is a class that you do workout moves in the form of dancing. This is a great way of conditioning and it does not even feel like you are working out. It is a fun and easy way to workout and lose weight. I go to my gym and participate in the workout and I would love to be able to teach the class someday. I have ten years of experience for dancing, so that makes it possible for me to be a dance fitness instructor.  I also love music. I am a big fan of Hip hop and R&B and can be a help to artists. I am always listening to music and singing. Even though I am not the best singer,  I can still sing all. the. words to many songs. Music is a way I can relieve stress and anxiety because I am constantly busy.I love attending concerts because it is a mix of singing and dancing.
        Another talent of mine is makeup. I love doing my own makeup as well as doing my friends. I have watched countless of youtube videos of people doing their makeup and people getting their makeup done. I know many tips and tricks on how to perfect someones face. In the future, I would love to be able to be a makeup artist and be able to share my talent with others.
